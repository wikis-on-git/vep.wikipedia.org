Should've known better<br />
Now I miss you, like Sahara misses rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it's true<br />
Maybe you're not gonna change<br />

I feel like you have two homes<br />
Yet I feel you are homeless<br />
Where we live I feel like a stranger,<br />
When you home I feel even stranger<br />

I live in no man's land<br />
With no way home like you don't understand<br />
Cuz you so here, you so there, not really anywhere…<br />
She said…<br />

Should've known better<br />
Now I miss you, like Sahara misses rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it's true<br />
Maybe you're not gonna change<br />

Feels like I'm always<br />
Living out of my suitcase<br />
What about all the years in between<br />
Just trying to find my place<br />

I live in no man's land<br />
With no way home like you don’t understand<br />
Cuz you so here, you so there not really anywhere… She said…<br />

We could've written words on a mountain high<br />
Reminding ourselves to keep climbing, right<br />
Sometimes we have to lose<br />
A part of us to find the truth<br />

Nothing more beautiful than the way<br />
You used to breathe me into your lungs and soul<br />
Sometimes we have to say<br />
I'm sorry I cant stay<br />

Should've known better<br />
Now I miss you, like Sahara misses rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it's true<br />
Maybe it's true<br />

Oooh… Should've known better<br />
Now I miss you, like Sahara misses rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it's true<br />
Maybe we're not gonna change<br />

Should've known better<br />
