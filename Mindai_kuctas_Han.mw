<!-- Ризван Хан — мусульманин, который вырос с братом Закиром и с матерью Разией в Мумбае. После смерти его матери, переезжает в Сан-Франциско, вслед за братом. Тем временем, он знакомится с Хасеной, женой его брата, которая она поставила диагноз, что он страдает синдромом Аспердера. Ризван начал работать в компании его брата по продукции с уходом для кожи. Во время работы встретил женщину Мандиру и её сыном Самиром. После свиданий, он женился на ней и переезжает в город Банвилль. Их соседи Марк и Сара Гаррик и их сын Райс. 

Семья была удивилсь новостью про трагедию 11 сентября. At the same time, the Khan family begins to experience hostility in their community, as well as other Muslims too and Reese begins to turn against Sam as well. One afternoon, an argument between them turns into a racially motivated schoolyard fight between Sameer and a gang of older students. Reese, acting on behalf of Sameer, tries to stop the fight, but is held back and Sameer, who pushes the gang to their temper by swearing at them, is finally finished off when a gang member kicks a soccer ball at him. Sameer later dies from his injuries. The gang then silences Reese by threatening to beat him up if he tells the authorities about it. A shattered Mandira blames Rizwan for Sameer's death, stating that Sameer "died only because his name was Khan." She then tells Rizwan that she no longer wants to be with him. When he asks her what he has to do to be together with Mandira, she sarcastically tells him that he has to tell the people of the United States and the President that his name is Khan and that he is not a terrorist.

Rizwan takes Mandira's request seriously, and thus sets out on a journey that takes him from one US state to another, in order to first meet President and later the new President-elect. During this quest, he travels to Wilhemina, Georgia and befriends Mama Jenny and her son Joel. It is revealed that Mama Jenny's husband, Joel's father, who was a U.S Army soldier, also died in the war in Afghanistan. Later, in Los Angeles, he prays in a mosque and overhears violent rhetoric from Dr. Faisal Rahman. He reports this to the FBI but there is no response at that moment. Later, while waiting in a crowd to meet President George W. Bush and repeating again and again, "My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist," Rizwan is arrested and placed in a prison by police who misinterpret his statement thinking he said he was a terrorist.

While in the prison he is interrogated as a terrorist suspect and meets the psychiatrist Radha who believes he is innocent. He is later released after a media campaign by some Indian student reporters Raj, Komal and Bobby Ahuja who prove his innocence by unearthing his attempts to inform the FBI about Faisal Rahman. After his release, he returns to hurricane-hit Wilhemina to help Mama Jenny and her son. His efforts attract media attention and numerous Muslims come to help as well, including Zakir and Haseena.

At the same time, a remorseful Reese confesses to Mandira and reveals the identities of the gang who killed Sameer. Mandira then simply says that it is still not enough. She then informs Detective Garcia who has been assisting her on the case, and Detective Garcia arrests the gang. Mandira later gets a call from Sarah to forgive Rizwan, "I've lost my husband; don't lose him."

Mandira realises her error, she joins Rizwan in Georgia, and their love rekindles. However, at the moment she arrives, Rizwan is stabbed by one of Dr. Faisal Rahman's followers, who accuses him of being a traitor to Islam, and Rizwan is rushed to the hospital. With Mandira's help, Rizwan survives and meets President-elect Barack Obama who tells him, "Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist". The film concludes with Rizwan and Mandira going back home. -->
