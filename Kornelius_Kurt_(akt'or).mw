== Biografii ==
<blockquote>Born and raised in the heart of Southern California, Curt Cornelius fell for the arts at the very young age of 9 years old. His affinity for the magic of cinema was sparked sometime in between the seventh and eighth time he saw "E.T. The Extra Terrestrial" in theaters...Needless to say, that "magic" has yet to let go of his imagination. Through his acting & creativity, Curt found an outlet to truly be himself, and a safe environment to explore his feelings.

His journey commenced on the stages of South Coast Repertory. He began as a student in their classrooms, and later performed as a young actor in their productions. Curt's most notable role on SCR's Main Stage was that of Young Scrooge in the Dickens classic "A Christmas Carol" starring Hal Landon Jr.

His career in Hollywood followed shortly thereafter. With the help of a dear family friend, Curt found himself with representation in no time. Hence, his quest to put his talents to the test in Los Angeles was under way. With additional training & persistence, Curt worked consistently as a professional actor throughout his teenage years.

Upon Graduating with Honors from Edison High School in Huntington Beach, Curt decided to further enrich his mind. He applied to the University of California at Los Angeles and was accepted...Four years later, he graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English Literature.

Post college, Curt fully resumed his Acting career once again. However, this time, as an adult.

His filmography includes Feature Films, Animated Features, Made for TV Movies, Episodic Television, Video Games, Commercials, Radio Ads, Short Films, and New Media.</blockquote>
